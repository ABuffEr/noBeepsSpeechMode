This add-on excludes beeps in the speech mode when pressing NVDA+s.
You can only toggle between off or talk.

## Changes for 2.0 ##
*	 Add-on help is available from the Add-ons Manager.

## Changes for 1.5 ##
*	 Added script category (speech).
*	 Check for an older version of the addon which is not community supported, and prompt user before removing it.

## Changes for 1.4 ##
*	 From this version, the messages about speech mode are automatically translated from NVDA in the correct language, no specific translation for addon required (with the possible obvious exception of manifest.ini and script documentation).

## Changes for 1.3 ##
*	 Fixed bug in translations support: added python sources to make strings translatable.

## Changes for 1.2 ##
*	 Initial version.
